### Description:

My task was to develop an API for a web-based social network application that enables users to share their thoughts, respond to their friends' thoughts, and manage their friend list. To accomplish this, I utilized Express.js for handling routing, MongoDB as the underlying database, and the Mongoose ODM for seamless interaction with the database.


### Technology:

Project is created with:

- Javascript
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- Mongoose


### Acceptance Criteria:

```
GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list
```


### Mock-Up:
